# Container Basics Glossary

This glossary provides an overview of key terms related to containerization, Docker, and cloud-native applications.

### Terms and Definitions

- **Agile**: An iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer issues.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: A distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.
- **Container**: Powered by the containerization engine, it is a standard unit of software that encapsulates the application code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings necessary for programmers to efficiently build, ship, and run applications.
- **Container Registry**: Used for the storage and distribution of named container images. It mainly stores images and retrieves them for deployments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: A series of steps that must be performed to deliver a new version of software, focused on improving software delivery through automation.
- **Cloud Native**: A cloud-native application is designed for a cloud computing architecture, hosted and run in the cloud to capitalize on its software delivery model.
- **Daemon-less**: A container runtime that does not rely on any specific program (daemon) to create objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes.
- **DevOps**: A set of practices, tools, and philosophy to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams.
- **Docker**: An open container platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- **Dockerfile**: A text document containing commands for building a Docker image.
- **Docker Client**: The primary way Docker users interact with Docker, sending commands to dockerd, the Docker daemon.
- **Docker Command Line Interface (CLI)**: The Docker client CLI allows users to issue commands to a Docker daemon.
- **Docker Daemon (dockerd)**: Manages Docker objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes.
- **Docker Hub**: A popular platform for creating, managing, and delivering container applications.
- **Docker Localhost**: Allows containers to share the host's networking stack, resolving `localhost` to the physical host.
- **Docker Remote Host**: A machine running Docker Engine with ports exposed for querying the Engine API.
- **Docker Networks**: Help isolate container communications for secure interaction.
- **Docker Plugins**: Such as a storage plugin, allow connections to external storage platforms.
- **Docker Storage**: Uses volumes and bind mounts to persist data beyond container lifecycle.
- **LXC**: Linux Containers enable multiple isolated Linux virtual environments on a single host.
- **IBM Cloud Container Registry**: Stores and distributes container images in a managed private registry.
- **Image**: An immutable file containing the source code, libraries, and dependencies needed for an application.
- **Immutability**: Images are read-only; changes require creating a new image.
- **Microservices**: A cloud-native architecture where applications are split into loosely coupled, independently deployable services.
- **Namespace**: A Linux kernel feature that isolates system resources, essential for Docker's isolation model.
- **Operating System Virtualization**: OS-level virtualization where the kernel enables isolated containers on a host.
- **Private Registry**: Restricts access to images to authorized users.
- **REST API**: A web API that conforms to the REST architecture, allowing interaction with RESTful services.
- **Registry**: A hosted service containing image repositories, responding to the Registry API.
- **Repository**: A set of Docker images with unique tags, often shared by pushing to a registry server.
- **Server Virtualization**: Divides a physical server into multiple isolated virtual servers.
- **Serverless**: A development model where developers build and run applications without managing servers.
- **Tag**: A label applied to a Docker image in a repository, distinguishing images in a repository.
